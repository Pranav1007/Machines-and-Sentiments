# Machines-and-Sentiments

As the world progresses exponentially in terms of technological advancements, computers are increasingly becoming an essential part of human life. Besides, computers are now capable of working in a manner, similar to the human brain. 
Our project revolves around one such concept - Sentiment Analysis  
Yes, machines can now understand human sentiments! 

## Our project is broadly divided into three parts:
## 1. A review system 
This aims to use sentiment analysis to predict the nature of a review entered by the user.

## 2. A movie recommender system 
This aims to recommend a set of movies that the user would like to watch, based on a movie that the user enters.

## 3. A chatbot - ROBO
Here, we have made an effort to engage the user in a conversation with the machine, alongwith the bot making use of the review and recommender system, to assist the user.


## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a machine learning tool that analyzes texts for polarity, from positive to negative. By training machine learning tools with examples of emotions in text, machines automatically learn how to detect sentiment without human input. It is one of the very useful applications of Natural Language Processing, which is the concept of computers analysing human language to produce productive outputs.
